# worker's command runs as a separate OS subprocess with no access to this coordinator's
# Python memory, so -- unlike a JSON status field on disk, which a same-OS-user worker could
# in principle influence via its own tool calls -- this registry cannot be forged by the
# worker it describes. It is the sole basis on which a peer workspace change is ever attributed
# to that peer's own legitimate concurrent activity rather than to this task.

# Keyed by (run_id, task_id) -> (worker_id, lease acquiredAt), recorded the moment
# execute_work_packet() confirms it genuinely holds that task's RUNNING lease and is about to
# launch its bounded subprocess. Unlike _ACTIVE_WORKSPACES's per-workspace-path keying, this is
# keyed on the task itself so a sibling task's own re-validation can, mid-window, retroactively
# confirm that a task it now sees in a different state really did go through a genuine,
# in-process execute_work_packet() invocation -- and was therefore not smuggled in via a forged
# out-of-process CLI/API call while this task's own execution held the coordinator's attention.
# A worker subprocess cannot fabricate an entry here for an arbitrary task_id: reaching this
# registration point already required passing this function's own ownership check (the task
# must be RUNNING under a real lease matching worker_id).
#
# This witness is bound to *one specific* lease -- worker_id plus the exact acquiredAt timestamp
# captured when this call registered it, not merely a task_id -- and a caller may only treat a
# sibling's observed change as legitimate when its *own* initial Run-state snapshot (taken before
# its own subprocess ever ran, and therefore itself un-forgeable by that subprocess) already
# shows that sibling genuinely RUNNING under this *exact* lease (see
# `_sibling_change_is_witnessed` in execute_work_packet). That requirement is what makes a stale
# or long-since-superseded entry harmless: once a lease has been consumed (the task has moved on
# to WAITING_RESOURCE or a retried task has acquired a brand-new lease with a different
# acquiredAt), no caller's own initial snapshot can ever again show that exact lease as RUNNING,
# so this entry can never again satisfy the match -- it is *functionally* expired the instant its
# lease is consumed, even though the dict entry itself is not proactively deleted (at most one
# entry per task_id is ever live at a time, since a new lease simply overwrites the old one, so
# this cannot grow unbounded). Without the exact-lease-match requirement, a bystander forging a
# later, unrelated transition against an already-WAITING_RESOURCE victim (whose genuine execution
# concluded long before this window even began) would otherwise be wrongly treated as witnessed.
