# Learning loop pack

The cited rule base for Architrave's durable learning loop: how an agent keeps useful repo knowledge across context loss without turning config into a transcript, stale-memory cache, or unsafe source of truth.

Grounded in current practice:
- **Anthropic — Building effective agents:** start simple, add agentic complexity only when it improves outcomes, show planning steps, use ground truth from the environment, pause for human checkpoints, define stopping conditions, and test tool interfaces.
- **Anthropic — Multi-agent research system:** save plans to memory before context loss, use filesystem artifacts instead of relaying everything through the lead agent, evaluate end state at checkpoints, start with small eval sets, add observability/tracing, and scale effort to task complexity.
- **Claude Code memory:** separate project instructions from auto memory; add durable instructions when the same correction repeats; keep always-loaded instructions concise and specific; use scoped rules for path-specific guidance; hooks enforce behavior while instructions only guide it.
- **GitHub Copilot instructions and Memory:** repo facts should include build commands, architecture, conventions, and validation steps; instructions should be short and broadly applicable; stored repo facts need citations and validation against the current branch to avoid stale behavior.
- **LangGraph memory model:** distinguish short-term thread memory from long-term memory; separate semantic facts, episodic experiences, and procedural instructions; prefer smaller scoped memory documents when a single profile becomes hard to update; evaluate memory behavior.
- **OpenAI / Promptfoo eval guidance:** describe desired behavior, run representative test inputs, analyze results, and iterate; treat prompt and agent changes as test-driven, not trial-and-error.
- **MCP tool spec:** model-controlled tools need user-visible invocation, human approval for sensitive operations, structured schemas, result validation, audit logs, and no trust in untrusted tool annotations.

## Memory taxonomy for Architrave

Architrave uses four different stores because each has a different job:

1. **Run artifacts (episodic memory):** `.architrave/runs/<run-id>/` records what happened in one task: intake, tournament, plan, gates, judge verdicts, runtime evidence, final status, and optional adaptive execution evidence. It is auditable and can resume after context loss, but it is not automatically treated as future instruction.
2. **Repo profile (semantic memory):** `.architrave/learning/repo-profile.md` is the concise, validated description of the repository: purpose, surfaces, architecture lanes, source-of-truth paths, build/test commands, recurring gotchas, and last-reviewed evidence.
3. **Candidate lessons (semantic/episodic bridge):** `.architrave/learning/repo-lessons.md` tracks repeated observations with evidence and occurrence counts. It is a review queue, not a command file.
4. **Promoted rules (procedural memory):** stable lessons move into `architrave.config.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, docs, or contracts after review. These are the places future agents are allowed to treat as standing guidance.

Artifacts are audit support, not delivery currency. Emit them at useful
boundaries—intake, material decision, candidate handoff, failed side-effect
reconciliation, integration gate, and completion—not after every micro-action.
Artifact/event counts never measure product progress.

## Promotion rules

- Do not write one-off discoveries directly into `architrave.config.json`. Config is for stable pointers, policy knobs, source-of-truth paths, and verified commands.
- Add a candidate lesson when a fact would save a future agent time or prevent a repeated mistake. Include evidence: run id, file/command, current branch/source, and whether it was validated.
- Promote after the configured threshold, usually two occurrences, or immediately for a high-severity validated safety/build fact with human approval.
- Before promotion, validate against the current branch. Stale facts from closed/unmerged branches must not affect behavior unless the codebase still substantiates them.
- For prose claims that cannot be proven by local link existence alone, run the semantic learning review helper. The provider-backed review emits JSONL findings for unsupported claims; the deterministic apply helper only marks exact matching learning lines as `UNVALIDATED:` so stale review output cannot mutate changed text.
- Keep always-loaded instruction files short and scoped. Use path-specific `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` or docs for local rules instead of stuffing every detail into `AGENTS.md`.
- Redact secrets. Learning artifacts may say a secret reference exists or a config file is required; they must not contain secret values, tokens, private keys, cookies, or credentials.
- Keep adaptive evidence concise: semantic intent and selection reason, requested binding, observed model/vendor/effort, fallback/escalation evidence, judge provenance, and available duration/token/tool metrics. Never store hidden reasoning or treat a producer's self-report as host observation.

## Repo profile shape

The repo profile should be compact enough to load/read quickly:

```markdown
# Architrave Repo Profile

## Purpose

## Surfaces And Lanes

## Source Of Truth

## Build And Test

## Architecture Map

## Recurring Gotchas

## Validated Facts

## Last Reviewed
```

Each durable fact should either cite a file/command/run artifact or be marked as unvalidated. When a fact becomes a standing instruction, move it to the appropriate promoted target and leave a short pointer in the profile.

## What the judge checks

The Adversarial Judge should treat missing learning artifacts on non-trivial work as a process gap, not as implementation failure by itself. It becomes a Blocker when the missing artifact hides an unsafe change, skipped sign-off, unverified runtime claim, stale lesson promotion, or secret leakage.
